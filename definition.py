# Data structures and algorithm
# They are systematic way of storing and organizing data in software so that it can be used efficiently.
# They are the main building block from which  complex system is built. Having an understanding of these foundation
# concept is extremely important in software design and this involves the following three important characteristics.
#   1. How algorithms manipulates infromation contained within the data structures.
#   2. How data is arranged in memory.
#   3. What the performance characteristics of particular data structures are.


# Python for Data
# Python has several built-in data structures, including lists, dictionaries and sets, which we used to
# build customized objects. In addition, there are a number of internal libraries, such as collections
# and math object which allow us to create more advanced data structures as well as perform calculations on
# those structures.
# Finally, there are the external libraries such as those found in SciPy packages. These allow us to perform 
# a range of advanced data tasks such as logistics and linear regression, visualization and mathematical calculations,
# such as operation on matrices and vectors.
# External libraries can be useful for an out-of-the-box solution. However we must also be aware that there is often
# a performance penalty compared to building customized objects from ground up. By learing how to code these objects 
# ourselves, we can target them to specific tasks, making them more efficient.
