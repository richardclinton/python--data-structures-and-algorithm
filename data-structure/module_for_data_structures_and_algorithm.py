# In addtion to the built-in data type,there are several Python modules that we can use
# to extend the built-in types and functions. In many cases these, these Python modules
# offer efficiency and programming advantages that allow us to simplify our code.
# The built-in data type, we have looked so far,strings,lists,dictionaries,tuples,sets as well as
# the decimal and fraction modules. They are often described by the term Abstarct Data Types (ADTs)
# ADT(s) can be considered mathematical specifications for the set of operataions that can be
# performed on data. They are defined by their behaviour rather than their implementation. In addition
# to the ADTs that we have looked at, there are several Python libraries that provide extensions to the
# built-in data-types.
