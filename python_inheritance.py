# Inheritance
# Is  one of most powerful features of object-oriented programming
# It allows us to inherit the functionality from other classes. It is possible to
# create a new class that modifies the behaviour of an existing class through inheritance.
# Inheritance means that if an object of one class is created by inheriting another class,
# the the object would have all functionality, methods and variables of both the classes;
# that is, the parent class and new class. The existing class from which we inherit the functionalities
# is called parent/base class, and the new class is called derived/child class.
# Inheritance in Python is done by passing the inherited class as an argument in the class definition
# It is often used to modify the behaviour of existing methods.
