# Generators
# We can create functions that do not just return one result but rather an
# entire sequence of results, by using the yield statement.
# Python contains generator functions, which are an easy way to create iterators and
# are especially useful as a replacement of unworkably long list.
# A generator yields items rather than build lists.
