# Classes
# Are a way to create new kinds of objects, and they are central to object-oriented programming.
# A class defines a set of attributes that are shared across instances of that class.Typically, classess are sets
# of functions, variables and properties.
# The functions defined inside a class are called instance methods. They apply some operations
# to the class instance by passing an instance of that class as the first argument. This argument is
# called `self` by convention, but it can be any legal identifier.
