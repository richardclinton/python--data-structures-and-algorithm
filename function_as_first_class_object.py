# In python, it is not only data types that are treated as objects.
# Both functions and classes are what are known as first class objects, allowing
# them to be manipulated in the same ways as built-in data types.
# By definition, first class objects are
#  1. Created at runtime
#  2. Assigned as variable or in a data structure
#  3. Passed as argument to a function
#  4. Returned as result of a function
