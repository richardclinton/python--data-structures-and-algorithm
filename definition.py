# Data structures and algorithm
# They are systematic way of storing and organizing data in software so that it can be used efficiently.
# They are the main building block from which  complex system is built. Having an understanding of these foundation
# concept is extremely important in software design and this involves the following three important characteristics.
#   1. How algorithms manipulates infromation contained within the data structures.
#   2. How data is arranged in memory.
#   3. What the performance characteristics of particular data structures are.
